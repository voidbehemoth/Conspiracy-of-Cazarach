    <h2 align="center" class="white">Welcome to the future</h2>
    <b class="center white">Welcome to the future! In the social deduction game Conspiracy of Cazarach, you play as an inhabitant of the previously small town of Cazarach. You know your 'role' which gives you certain abilities. You do not know other players' roles.</b>
    <h2 align="center" class="white">The Factions</h2>
    <b class="center white">There are a few factions in Conspiracy of Cazarach. Each one has it's own goals, whether it be to come out on top or to stay hidden.</b>
    <h3 align="center" class="white">The Village</h3>
    <b class="center white">The Village represents the common folk of Cazarach. In a game there will typically be more Village members than any other faction. What keeps the Village from dominating a game is that Village members do not know who is a Village member and who isn't a Village member. Apart from that, the Village typically minds their own business. All Village members win with each other. </b>
    <img src="\icons/Agency-Icon.png" width="500" class="center_1">
    <h3 align="center" class="white">The Agency</h3>
    <b class="center white">Some Village members have recently been noticing peculiar individuals inspecting Cazarach. Enter the Agency, paranormal investigators and crime fighters who have recently been assigned to Cazarach. Unlike the Village, Agency members know who is and isn't in the Agency. Despite being shrouded in mystery, the Agency shares a lot of goals with the Village, this means that Agency members can win with Village members. As an Agency member, your goal is to eliminate all threats to the Village and national security.</b>
